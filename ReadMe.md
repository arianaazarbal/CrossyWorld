## Game Description
This game is kind of like crossy roads! It produces an infinite stream of roads/sidewalks
and has blue and red balls "driving" across the roads. You must get as high a score as you
can by moving forward (using the up or w key; you can also navigate left, right, and down 
using those keys or a, s, d). If you collide with a driver, or don't move fast enough 
(your player reaches the bottom of 
the screen, you lose. The game demands you go ever-faster as your score increases.
Right now,the stream capabilities aren't really maximized but in the future I could 
place bushes or something on the sidewalks at random points each time, easily. 
The entry of cars is randomized, so it can't be predicted.
